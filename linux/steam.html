          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
          <p>- Among Us on Steam</p>
          <p>- Protontricks from your preferred Flatpak manager</p>
          <h2>Installation and Downgrading</h2>
          <p>
            To start, install Among Us through Steam. If downgrading is
            required, you can do so by clicking "Properties", then "Betas", then
            selecting "public-previous". Once you've installed the game,
            navigate to its install folder - "Manage", then "Browse local
            files". Duplicate the folder that Among Us is installed to, rename
            it to something like "Among Us (ToU)", and proceed to the next step.
          </p>
          <h2>Mod Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Downlod the "ToU.<span class="version"></span>.zip" file from
            <a href="https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest"
              >this repository</a
            >. Extract the contents of the archive into your "Among Us (ToU)
            folder - your "Among Us.exe" should be in the same directory as the
            "BepInEx" folder. In Steam, navigate to the bottom left "Add a Game"
            button and select "Add a non-Steam game". Select your "Among Us.exe"
            from the "Among Us (ToU)" folder. Next, click "Properties", then
            "Compatibility", then "Enable the use of a specific Steam Play
            compatibility tool". Select your preferred Proton version from the
            drop-down menu - I use 9.0-4, but most versions should work.
          </p>
          <h2>DLL Override</h2>
          <p>
            Open Protontricks. Scroll down to the entry for your "Non-steam
            shortcut: [name of shortcut]". Select it, then select "Edit the
            default wine prefix", then "Run winecfg". In winecfg, click
            "Libraries". Enter "winhttp" into the text box, click "Add" and then
            "OK". You can now exit Protontricks.
          </p>
          <h2>You're Done!</h2>
          <p>
            If all has gone well, launching your Steam shortcut for Town of Us
            should open Among Us with the ToU logo on the home screen. Happy
            tasking!
          </p>
