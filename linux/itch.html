          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
          <p>- Among Us on itch.io</p>
          <p>- Steam</p>
          <p>- Protontricks from your preferred Flatpak manager</p>
          <h2>Installation and Downgrading</h2>
          <p>
            To start, download the correct Among Us version from itch.io. If
            latest version isn't supported, make sure to download the previous
            release version. Once you've downloaded the game, navigate to its
            folder, name it to something like "Among Us (ToU)", and proceed to
            the next step.
          </p>
          <h2>Mod Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Download the "ToU.<span id="version"></span>.zip" file from
            <a href="https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest"
              >this repository</a
            >. Extract the contents of the archive into your "Among Us (ToU)"
            folder - "Among Us.exe" and the
            "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place. In Steam, navigate to the bottom left "Add a Game"
            button and select "Add a non-Steam game". Select your "Among Us.exe"
            from the "Among Us (ToU)" folder. Next, click "Properties", then
            "Compatibility", then "Enable the use of a specific Steam Play
            compatibility tool". Select your preferred Proton version from the
            drop-down menu - I use 9.0-4, but most versions should work. Launch this shortcut once - it won't load the mod correctly, but it's needed for the next step.
          </p>
          <h2>DLL Override</h2>
          <p>
            Open Protontricks. Scroll down to the entry for your "Non-steam
            shortcut: [name of shortcut]". Select it, then select "Edit the
            default wine prefix", then "Run winecfg". In winecfg, click
            "Libraries". Enter "winhttp" into the text box, click "Add" and then
            "OK". You can now exit Protontricks.
          </p>
          <h2>You're Done!</h2>
          <p>
            If all has gone well, launching your Steam shortcut for Town of Us
            should open Among Us with the ToU logo on the home screen. Happy
            tasking!
          </p>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p>
            This guide works as-is on Steam Deck, but ToUR's controller support is imperfect. You'll want to use a mouse and keyboard to play or do a lot of controller configuration.
