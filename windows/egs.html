          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
          <p>- Among Us on Epic Games</p>
          <h2>Latest Version</h2>
          <p>ONLY IF LATEST VERSION IS SUPPORTED</p>
          <p>
            To start, install Among Us through Epic Games. Find your game's
            install directory and duplicate the game folder. Rename it to
            something like "Among Us (ToU)". Download
            <a
              href="https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesStarter/releases/latest"
              >this zip file</a
            >, unzip it, and place the exe file inside your copied folder.
            Proceed to "Mod Installation".
          </p>
          <h2>Downgrade</h2>
          <p>ONLY IF LATEST VERSION IS UNSUPPORTED</p>
          <p>
            Make sure Epic Games is open and you're signed in. Open the
            PowerShell app and run the command:
          </p>
          <code id="pwrshell-egs">
            iwr
            https://github.com/whichtwix/EpicGamesDowngrader/releases/latest/download/DowngradeEpic.ps1
            -UseBasicParsing | iex
          </code>
          <button onclick="copyCode('pwrshell-egs', this)">Copy code</button>
          <p>
            You may have to press "Y" a few times through the prompts on screen.
            Once it has finished, your downgraded folder will be at
            "C:\Users\[YOUR NAME]\Games\AmongUs". Proceed to "Mod Installation".
          </p>
          <h2>Mod Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Download the "ToU.<span id="version"></span>.zip" file from
            <a href="https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest"
              >this repository</a
            >. Extract the contents of the archive into your game folder - your
            "Among Us.exe" should be in the same directory as the "BepInEx"
            folder.
          </p>

          <h2>You're Done!</h2>
          <p>
            If all has gone well, launching "EpicGamesStarter.exe" in the "Among
            Us (ToU)" folder should open Among Us with the ToU logo on the home
            screen. Happy tasking!
          </p>
