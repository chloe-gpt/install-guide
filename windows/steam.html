          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
          <p>- Among Us on Steam</p>
          <h2>Installation and Downgrading</h2>
          <p>
            To start, install Among Us through Steam. If downgrading is
            required, you can do so by clicking "Properties", then "Betas", then
            selecting "public-previous". Once you've installed the game,
            navigate to its install folder - "Manage", then "Browse local
            files". Duplicate the folder that Among Us is installed to, rename
            it to something like "Among Us (ToU)", and proceed to the next step.
          </p>
          <h2>Mod Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Download the "ToU.<span id="version"></span>.zip" file from
            <a href="https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest"
              >this repository</a
            >. Extract the contents of the archive into your "Among Us (ToU)"
            folder - your "Among Us.exe" should be in the same directory as the
            "BepInEx" folder.
          </p>
          <h2>You're Done!</h2>
          <p>
            If all has gone well, launching the .exe file in the "Among Us
            (ToU)" folder should open Among Us with the Town of Us logo on the
            home screen. Happy tasking!
          </p>
