          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
          <p>- Among Us on itch.io (and itch.io app)</p>
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>
            To start, install Among Us in the itch.io app. If downgrading is required, go to your Library, right-click Among Us, then "Manage", then "Switch to another version...". Select the correct version, currently "version 103".
          </p>
          <h2>Mod Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Right-click on Among Us again, then "Manage", then "Open folder in explorer". Download the "ToU.<span id="version_number"></span>.zip" file from
            <a href="https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R/releases/latest"
              >this repository</a
            >. Extract the contents of the archive into your game folder - "Among Us.exe" and the
            "BepInEx" folder should both be visible in the same place.
          </p>
          <h2>You're Done!</h2>
          <p>
            If all has gone well, launching "Among Us.exe" should open Among Us
            with the ToU logo on the home screen. Happy tasking!
          </p>
